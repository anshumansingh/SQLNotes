## Views

Imagine in sakillaDB, I frequently have queries of the following type:
 - Given an actor, give me the name of all films they have acted in. 
 - Given a film, give me the name of all actors who have acted in it. 

Getting the above requires a join across 3 tables, `film`, `film_actor` and `actor`. 

Why is that an issue?
 - Writing these queries time after time is cumbersome. Infact imagine queries that are even more complex - requiring joins across a lot of tables with complex conditions. Writing those everytime with 100% accuracy is difficult and time-taking. 
 - Not every team would understand the schema really well to pull data with ease. And understanding the entire schema for a large, complicated system would be hard and would slow down teams. 

So, what's the solution? 
Databases allow for creation of views. Think of views as an alias which when referred is replaced by the query you store with the view.

So, a query like the following:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE view actor_film_name AS

SELECT
   concat(a.first_name, a.last_name) AS actor_name,
   f.title AS file_name
FROM actor a
  JOIN film_actor fa 
    ON fa.actor_id = a.actor_id 
  JOIN film f
    ON f.film_id = fa.film_id
```


**Note that a view is not a table.** It runs the query on the go, and hence data redundancy is not a problem. 

### Operating with views

Once a view is created, you can use it in queries like a table. Note that in background the view is replaced by the query itself with view name as alias. 
Let's see with an example. 

```sql
SELECT film_name FROM
actor_film_name WHERE actor_name = "JOE SWANK"
```

OR 

```sql
SELECT actor_name FROM
actor_file_name WHERE film_name = "AGENT TRUMAN"
```

If you see, with views it's super simple to write queries that I write frequently. Lesser chances to make an error.
Note that however, actor_file_name above is not a separate table but more of an alias.

An easy way to understand that is that assume every occurrence of `actor_file_name` is replaced by

```sql
(SELECT
   concat(a.first_name, a.last_name) AS actor_name,
   f.title AS file_name
FROM actor a
  JOIN film_actor fa 
    ON fa.actor_id = a.actor_id 
  JOIN film f
    ON f.film_id = fa.film_id) AS actor_file_name
```

**Caveat:** Certain DBMS natively support materialised views. Materialised views are views with a difference that the views also store results of the query. This means there is redundancy and can lead to inconsistency / performance concerns with too many views. But it helps drastically improve the performance of queries using views. MySQL for example does not support materialised views. Materialised views are tricky and should not be created unless absolutely necessary for
performance. 

#### How to best leverage views

Imagine there is an enterprise team at Scaler which helps with placements of the students. 
Should they learn about the entire Scaler schema? Not really. They are only concerned with student details, their resume, Module wise PSP, Module wise Mock Interview clearance, companies details and student status in the companies where they have applied.  

In such a case, can we create views which gets all of the information in 1 or 2 tables? If we can, then they need to only understand those 2 tables and can work with that. 

#### More operations on views

**How to get all views in the database:**

```sql
SHOW FULL TABLES WHERE table_type = 'VIEW';
```

**Dropping a view** 

```sql
DROP VIEW actor_file_name;
```

**Updating a view**

```sql
ALTER view actor_film_name AS

 SELECT
    concat(a.first_name, a.last_name) AS actor_name,
    f.title AS file_name
 FROM actor a
   JOIN film_actor fa
     ON fa.actor_id = a.actor_id
   JOIN film f
     ON f.film_id = fa.film_id
```

**Note:** Not recommended to run update on views to update the data in the underlying tables. Best practice to use views for reading information. 

**See the original create statement for a view**

```sql
SHOW CREATE TABLE actor_film_name
```

## Window Function

Imagine you have an `employees` table with the following columns. 

```sql
employees
emp_no    |  department  | salary
  1       |   Tech       | 60,000
  2       |   Tech       | 50,000
  3       |    HR        | 40,000
  4       |    HR        | 60,000
```

If I ask you to fetch the average salary for every department, what would you do? 
Yes, you would use a group_by to fetch the avg salary in a department. 

```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
```

which will print 

```
department  |  AVG(salary)
 Tech       |   55000
 HR         |   50000
```

However, what if I ask you to print every row in the employees table along with the avg salary of the department. 
You can use WINDOW function for that. Window function is exactly like group by, just that it prints it's output for every row. 

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT 
  emp_no, 
  department, 
  salary,
  AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department) AS dept_avg
FROM employees
```

The term `OVER` indicates that I am using a window function. 
Just like group by, window function would need to define what is a group like. For that, it uses PARTITION BY. `PARTITION BY department` creates 2 groups/windows - one for Tech, one for HR. 
In each group, you calculate the aggregate function specified before `OVER`.

So, the above query yields:

```sql
employees
emp_no    |  department  | salary | dept_avg
  1       |   Tech       | 60,000 |  55000
  2       |   Tech       | 50,000 |  55000
  3       |    HR        | 40,000 |  50000
  4       |    HR        | 60,000 |  50000
```

What happens if there is no Partition by? What's the group then?
Correct. The entire table becomes the group. 

So, the following query:

```sql
SELECT 
  emp_no, 
  department, 
  salary,
  AVG(salary) OVER () AS dept_avg
FROM employees
```

yields


```sql
employees
emp_no    |  department  | salary | dept_avg
  1       |   Tech       | 60,000 |  52500
  2       |   Tech       | 50,000 |  52500
  3       |    HR        | 40,000 |  52500
  4       |    HR        | 60,000 |  52500
```

You can have multiple window function in the same SQL statement. For example, how do I print MAX, MIN and AVG salary in every department along with the employee? 

```sql
SELECT 
  emp_no, 
  department, 
  salary,
  AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department) AS dept_avg,
  MAX(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department) AS dept_max,
  MIN(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department) AS dept_min
FROM employees
```

This would yield:

```sql
employees
emp_no    |  department  | salary | dept_avg | dept_max | dept_min 
  1       |   Tech       | 60,000 |  55000   |  60000   | 50000
  2       |   Tech       | 50,000 |  55000   |  60000   | 50000
  3       |    HR        | 40,000 |  50000   |  60000   | 40000
  4       |    HR        | 60,000 |  50000   |  60000   | 40000
```

*You can have multiple window functions with different partition by in a SQL query. Just that it would do more work - twice as expensive. It would create different groups / windows in parallel and then calculate the aggregate value.*

Window function also allows you to order entries in a certain order within a group / partition / window. For example, if I wanted that within a single department, entries are sorted based on salary in descending order, I can write:


```sql
SELECT 
  emp_no, 
  department, 
  salary,
  AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dept_avg
FROM employees
```

which would yield:

```sql
employees
emp_no    |  department  | salary | dept_avg
  1       |   Tech       | 60,000 |  60000
  2       |   Tech       | 50,000 |  55000
  4       |    HR        | 60,000 |  60000
  3       |    HR        | 40,000 |  50000
```

### Aggregate function which work only with Window function. 

**RANK()** - Gives the rank of every entry in the group/window/partition it belongs to. It is recommended to specify a order by clause in window function when using rank(). Ranking is done based on the ordering of entries within a partitio. 
Imagine I wanted to print all employees along with their department rank based on salary. 

```sql
SELECT 
  emp_no, 
  department, 
  salary,
  RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dept_rank
FROM employees
```

which yields


```sql
employees
emp_no    |  department  | salary | dept_rank
  1       |   Tech       | 60,000 |  1
  2       |   Tech       | 50,000 |  2
  4       |    HR        | 60,000 |  1
  3       |    HR        | 40,000 |  2
```

In the absence of partition by, the entire table becomes one large group and hence salaries are ranked in the entire company. 

```sql
SELECT 
  emp_no, 
  department, 
  salary,
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS company_rank
FROM employees
```

yields


```sql
employees
emp_no    |  department  | salary | company_rank
  1       |   Tech       | 60,000 |  1
  4       |    HR        | 60,000 |  1
  2       |   Tech       | 50,000 |  3
  3       |    HR        | 40,000 |  4
```

Note that 2 entries with the same salary got the same rank. How do I know that I need to compare salaries (because that's whats specified in order by clause). Conflicting entries get the same rank. And next entry (after the duplicate/conflicting entries) gets a number which it would have gotten had the entries been different. 
If you want the next entry to get the next natural number, then you can use the **dense_rank()** function which works exactly like the rank() function with the only difference being how the next entry is assigned a rank in case of duplicate values. 

**DENSE_RANK()** - Explained above. 

**ROW_NUMBER()** - Imagine in the above rank() example, you don't want same ranks assigned to entries with the same value. In that case, you can use row_number(). 

```sql
SELECT 
  emp_no, 
  department, 
  salary,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS company_rank
FROM employees
```

yields

```sql
employees
emp_no    |  department  | salary | company_rank
  1       |   Tech       | 60,000 |  1
  4       |    HR        | 60,000 |  2
  2       |   Tech       | 50,000 |  3
  3       |    HR        | 40,000 |  4
```


**LAG(column) / LEAD(column)**: Imagine in the above context, I wanted to print the value from the previous row in the group, or the next row in the group, then I use the lead or lag functions.
LAG(column) - As the name indicates, it prints the column value from the previous row in the group. 
LEAD(column) - column value from the next row in the group. 
For example, what if I wanted to print the next higher salary than me in the department (or the next lower) along with my rank. 

```sql
SELECT 
  emp_no, 
  department, 
  salary,
  RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dept_rank,
  LAG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS next_higher_salary
FROM employees
```

yields 

```sql
employees
emp_no    |  department  | salary | dept_rank | next_higher_salary
  1       |   Tech       | 60,000 |  1        |  NULL
  2       |   Tech       | 50,000 |  2        |  60000
  4       |    HR        | 60,000 |  1        |  NULL
  3       |    HR        | 40,000 |  2        |  60000
```
